OpenAPI Pagination Standard
In SeaTalk Open Platform, we use a "cursor"-based pagination method to divide a long list into multiple pages to improve the response time of server APIs. When you call a relevant API for the first time, the SeaTalk Open Platform server will store a "snapshot" of the result and send it back to you in smaller batches controlled by "page_size" and connected by "cursors". See the following for an introduction to how pagination is implemented so you can understand how specific server APIs are designed.

How to Use the Pagination Function
In the first request of the server API, you need to provide us with the query info including:

What is the list of entities the request wants to retrieve (e.g. a list of employees under department "Shopee → Singapore", or a list of departments under "Shopee → Singapore")
What is the length of the list to be retrieved in this request (e.g. 10 items or 50 items)
Example of a First Request (Body)
// Using example of Get Department API
{
    "department_code": "SHOPEE APPS UAT",
    "page_size": 10,
    "fetch_child": "true"
}

Copy
SeaTalk Open Platform will respond with the desired segment of the data you want.

// For Get Department API
{
      "code": 0,
      "departments": [{
            "department_code": "12",
            "name": "Human Resource",
            "department_alias": "",
            "lead_employee_code": "998",
            "visibility_info": [{
            "is_hidden": false,
            "hide_type": 0,
            "department_whitelist": ["20", "21"]
      }],
      "direct_employee_count": 15,
      "parent_department_code": "10"
},
{
      ... // Another department
},
      ... // More departments
],
      "next_cursor": "MZYlo=TEc5VdXNlcjV0" // This cursor will be used in the next request. 
      // If the "next_cursor" is empty, it means there is no more data left 
}

Copy
After receiving the response, you can put the "next_cursor"  info into the "cursor" section in the new request together with the desired item length to get the next batch of responses and a new cursor.

Example of a Following Request (Body)
// Using example of Get Department API
{
    "department_code": "SHOPEE APPS UAT",
    "page_size": 10,
    "fetch_child": "true",
    "cursor": "MZYlo=TEc5VdXNlcjV0"
}
