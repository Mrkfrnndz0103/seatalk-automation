Event: Bot Added To Group Chat
Event Description
When the event bot_added_to_group_chat is triggered, it means a user has added your bot to a group chat in SeaTalk. This event allows your bot to detect when it has been added to a new group and take actions such as sending a welcome message or initializing group-specific settings.

Note: When a bot creates a group using the SeaTalk API, the bot itself is not automatically added as a member of the group hence the event bot_added_to_group_chat will not be triggered.
