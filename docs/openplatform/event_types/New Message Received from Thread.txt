Event: New Message Received from Thread
Event Description
This event is triggered when a new message is posted in a thread where the bot has already been previously mentioned or has sent the root message. It allows bots to follow the thread and respond without requiring repeated mentions. 

Note:

No event callback will be sent if the bot is not online.
The bot must remain in the group chat and be part of the thread's follower list to continue receiving this event

Messages sent by the bot itself will not trigger this callback.
